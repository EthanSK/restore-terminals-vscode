# Restore Terminals

Automatically spawn integrated terminal windows and split terminals, and run any shell commands when VSCode starts up!

## How to use

Simply configure your VSCode settings JSON file to look something like this:

```json
 "restoreTerminals.terminals": [
    {
      "splitTerminals": [
        {
          "name": "server",
          "commands": ["npm i", "npm run dev"],
          "color": "red"
        },
        {
          "name": "client",
          "commands": ["npm run dev:client"]
        },
        {
          "name": "test",
          "commands": ["jest --watch"]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "profile": "Git Bash"
      "splitTerminals": [
        {
          "name": "build & e2e",
          "commands": ["npm run eslint", "npm run build", "npm run e2e"],
          "shouldRunCommands": false
        },
        {
          "name": "worker",
          "commands": ["npm-run-all --parallel redis tsc-watch-start worker"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```

The outer array represents a integrated VSCode terminal window, and the `splitTerminals` array contains the information about how each terminal window should be split up.

You can also use a custom config file under. The file should be at `.vscode/restore-terminals.json` in any workspace you want. A sample config file is [here](https://github.com/EthanSK/restore-terminals-vscode/blob/master/.vscode/SAMPLE_restore-terminals.json). If this config file is present, Restore Terminals will try and load settings from it first, then use `settings.json` as a fallback.

## Extra info

The order of split terminals from left to right is the order in the array.

You can manually trigger the restoration of terminals by running `Restore Terminals` in the command palette.

If you find the extension glitching out, try increasing the `restoreTerminals.artificialDelayMilliseconds` setting to a higher number, such as `1000`.

If you do not want this extension to close the currently open terminal windows, you can simply set `restoreTerminals.keepExistingTerminalsOpen` to `true`.

If you do not want it to restore terminals on VSCode startup, but instead only run when you trigger it manually from the command palette, then set `restoreTerminals.runOnStartup` to `false`.

If you don't want the commands to actually run, just be pasted in the terminal, then set `shouldRunCommands` to `false` in each `splitTerminals` object.

If you don't like using split terminals, then just provide one object in each split terminal array, which should be the intuitive thing to do.

Color is not currently supported for split terminals. Only the first terminal will have the color.
